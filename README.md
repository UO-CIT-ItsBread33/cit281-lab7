# Welcome to the Cit 281 Lab 7 Page

### What I learned:

- Creating an Organization for the CIT Minor.
- Learning about Github Repositories.
- Cloning repositories to my PC so I can push files and changes directly to the repository.
- introduction to error handling.

### Purpose of Lab:

- Here we created my GitHub account, as well as create an organization for the CIT minor.
- We learned about the fundamentals of GitHub and how it can be useful for sharing code as well as collaborating. 
- This lab also taught us how we can directly push files and changes from our local system using Windows Prompt.
- We then learned how to handle errors using try..catch..finally.
